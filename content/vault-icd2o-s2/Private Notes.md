# End of Module Portfolio Reviews

## Janelle

93 (reasonable!) (maybe 94..)

## Khalid

(no grade estimate, but I'd say 90, maybe 92 max – planning is a big learning goal, not well addressed – portfolio a bit sparse – focus on Communication as a key skill, on top of already strong technical skills)

## Audrey

Self-eval is a little bit incomplete. No real evidence of planning throughout mod. Max 85%; more if she can add evidence of plans in to her portfolio.

## Jonas

95 – sure? Maybe more like 93? 

## Samson

asked for 80, 65 is the best I could offer (a lot of portfolio entries incomplete, only the paired driver-navigator image analysis was really done well)

## Jimin

No grade estimate, 90% max (no plans at all in portfolio)

## Shiyi

96%

## Jordan

93%

## Sadie

90% max (no plans at all in portfolio)

## Masa

90% max (no plans at all in portfolio)

## Yahiro

81 (no evidence of use of functions, but really dedicated while in class, willing to ask questions)

## Hayden

80 (no evidence of use of functions, but really dedicated while in class, willing to ask questions)

## Chloe

93-95 (needs to finish self-assessment though)

## Jayda

95% (advanced use of functions, good planning)

## Vitalina

90% max (no plans at all in portfolio)
