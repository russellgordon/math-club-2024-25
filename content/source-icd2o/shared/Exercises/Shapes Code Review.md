# Shapes Code Review

In this activity, we reviewed the code authored by another student for the [[Shapes]] activity from a previous class.

## Discussion

In our conversation the following strategies were identified for how to write readable code.

### Whitespace

We can use blank lines to separate code that accomplishes each part of a task.

For example:

![[Screenshot+2022-09-20+at+11.43.05+AM.png]]

###  Use of comments

We can write comments that describe our intent.

For example:

![[Screen+Shot+2022-09-20+at+19.05.05.png|500]]

![[Screen+Shot+2022-09-20+at+19.05.15.png|450]]

![[Screen+Shot+2022-09-20+at+19.05.25.png|400]]

![[Screen+Shot+2022-09-20+at+19.04.54.png|400]]

### Colour

Depending on our goals, we might choose to vary colour to tell one part of our drawing apart from another.

For example, in the [[Subscribe to Turtle Sketches|Turtle Sketches]] environment, we can adjust pen color and fill colour, like this:

```swift
turtle.penColor = .purple
turtle.fillColor = .orange
```

## Conclusion

Code is written once, but read many times.

Given this it is ideal that code be as readable as possible by humans.
