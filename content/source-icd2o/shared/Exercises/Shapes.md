## Objective
Draw a regular triangle, a square, and a regular pentagon in a sketch.
Separate shapes so that there is some space between them, like this:

![[regularpolygons.png]]

## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Installing Playgrounds|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] The [[Subscribe to Turtle Sketches|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Shapes*
- [ ] A partner to engage in the *Driver-Navigator* paired programming model.

## Success criteria
- [ ] a regular triangle, square, and pentagon are drawn, separated by some empty space
- [ ] code includes [[Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently|correctly indented]]

## Reflection prompts
1. What problems did you encounter when completing this task? How did you and your partner resolve them?
2. How did your code differ from code written by another group? Did you learn anything new by comparing your code to someone else's?

Make a post on [Notion](https://notion.so) to:
- [ ] share at least one screenshot of your group's work on this task
- [ ] briefly respond to the prompts above

## Extension

Consider the diagram below – the exterior angle of a regular polygon is formed between an edge and the dotted line shown:

![[exterior-angles.png]]

1. What is true about the interior and exterior angles of a square, or, four-sided regular polygon?

2. What is the interior angle of an equilateral triangle, or, a three-sided regular polygon? What is the corresponding exterior angle?

3. Can you fill in a table of values that relates $n$, the number of sides in a polygon, to the measure of the interior and exterior angles?

Try making a table like this on a sheet of paper, then extending the pattern for a five-sided, six sided, and seven-sided regular polygon:

|$n$, number of sides|interior angle measure|exterior angle measure|
|-|---|---|
|3| | |
|4|90°| |
|5| | |
|6| | |
|7| | |
