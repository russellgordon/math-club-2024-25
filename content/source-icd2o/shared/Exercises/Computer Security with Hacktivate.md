# Computer Security with Hacktivate

## Introduction

[Hacktivate](https://www.hacktivate.io) is a website authored by Paul Hudson, a software developer and teacher based in the United Kingdom.

It is a series of capture-the-flag challenges designed to help learners understand computer security, programming concepts, and how data is stored on a computer.

Paul created Hacktivate to help his daughter and her friends prepare for cybersecurity competitions, and he has kindly made these activities available to other schools around the world.

## What to do

You have been emailed login instructions.

Working with your partner, watch the videos together.

As you complete each challenge, take note of *terminology* or *concepts* that are new to you.

Write very briefly about that in your daily portfolio entry in [Notion](https://notion.so) – think of this as your space to take notes. What do you want to remember, weeks from now?

Do your best to complete challenges during our classes this week.

You *are* expected to complete a portfolio entry in Notion for each day of class, but you are *not* being directly evaluated on what you complete in Hacktivate.

There *is* a leaderboard for the teams in our class – who will come out on top? Perhaps it will be you and your partner!

Be sure to ask questions in [Notion](https://notion.so) about what you want to learn more about. My hope is that completing Hacktivate challenges will spark your curiousity about other topics connected to technology! 🚀
