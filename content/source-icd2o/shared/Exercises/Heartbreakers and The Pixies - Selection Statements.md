Recently we have seen how *nested loops* – a loop inside of another loop – can be used to create a grid of shapes.

For example, consider this poster for The Heartbreakers:

![[the heartbreakers - no grid copy.png|511]]

The exact code for how that grid is created is not important right now.

The key question at hand:

> How are some squares made to be white, and others blue?

The answer is that this comes down to *selection*.

When a certain *condition* is true, we draw white squares.

Otherwise, we draw blue squares.

## Syntax

There are multiple types of programming language structures that allow for selection to occur.

In this discussion, we will look at `if` statements.

The general syntax is:

![[Pasted image 20221216083514.png|225]]

In that example, only when the `condition` evaluates to `true` does the block of code inside the `{ }` brackets get selected to be run. Otherwise, the block of code is skipped.

Here is another example:

![[Pasted image 20221216083829.png|175]]

In this example, when the `condition` is `true` the first block of code runs. Otherwise, `else`,  the second block of code runs.

## Application in Heartbreakers poster

It is the second example that is being used in this poster:

![[the heartbreakers - no grid copy.png|511]]

The precise code is:

Let's dig into that a bit further. How did we come up with the condition to check for?

Adding some code inside the loops that draw the squares is helpful:

It is not strictly necessary that you understand that code, only that you are aware of what it produces – please examine the following output:

![[the heartbreakers - positions showing copy.png|800]]

What we are seeing, for each square, is:

1. The co-ordinates of the anchor of the square.
2. The sum of the $x$ and $y$ co-ordinates for each square.

Looking carefully at the sum of the co-ordinates for the squares that exist along the diagonal where we want the colour to change, we may notice something of interest:

![[the heartbreakers - positions showing copy 2.png|800]]

The sums on all the squares along that diagonal of interest is $-290.0$.

Having looked carefully, we now have our condition.

We write this `if` statement:

![[Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 8.41.29 AM.png|350]]

... and we are *selecting* a portion of the squares to be drawn with a white fill:

![[the heartbreakers - positions showing copy 3.png|810]]

Any squares where the sum of the co-ordinates is greater than $-290$ will be drawn in white.

All other squares are drawn in blue.

## Arithmetic operators

The co-ordinates for the anchor position of each square were added using the `+` operator inside the `if` statement's condition:

Here is the complete list of arithmetic operators that can be used in an expression:

![[Pasted image 20221216085929.png|400]]

Note that the usual order of operations will be respected when brackets are used.

## Comparison operators

We compared the sum of the co-ordinates for each square's anchor position to the value `-290`, using the `>` operator:

Here is the complete list of comparison operators that can be used in an expression:

![[Pasted image 20221216090240.png|400]]

## Checking multiple conditions

In certain circumstances it is useful to check multiple conditions with an `if` statement.

### Logical AND

Should we want to select a block of code to be run only when *both* conditions are true, we use the `&&` operator, which is read as "and".

For example:

![[Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 2.01.18 PM.png|475]]

### Logical OR

Should we want to select a block of code to be run when *either* conditions are true, we use the `||` operator, which is read as "or".

For example:

## Exercise: Pixies

Apply the principles you have been introduced to above to build the following poster:

![[pixies - no grid copy.png|800]]

Here is the poster with a grid:

> [!TIP]
> It will be helpful to have the following code in your program at some point, to see the position and co-ordinates of each circle:
> ```
> // Draw the co-ordinates of the anchor point
> turtle.drawText(message: "(\(i), \(j))",
> 				at: Point(x: i - 30,
> 					  y: j),
> 				size: 12)
> 
> // Draw the sum of the anchor point co-ordinates
> turtle.drawText(message: "Sum: \(i + j)",
> 				at: Point(x: i - 30,
> 					  y: j - 10),
> 				size: 12)
> ```
