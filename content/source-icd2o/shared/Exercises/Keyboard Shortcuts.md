In this activity, you will learn more about common *keyboard shortcuts* available on macOS.

## What you'll need to begin

Please download the [Keyboard Shortcuts app](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/KeyboardShortcuts.zip) that was written by Mr. Gordon.

A **.zip** file will be placed in your **Downloads** folder.

Double-click the **.zip** file to open it.

### Instructions

Take time to explore the shortcuts.

Be sure to try them out yourself, on your actual computer!

Find at least *five* shortcuts and mark them as favourites within the app.

Post a screenshot of your favourite shortcuts in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).

Select two of those shortcuts and write about how you think you will find them useful on an ongoing basis.
