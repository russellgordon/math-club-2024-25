In this activity, we first asked the class to give the "computer" instructions to tie their shoelaces.

Later, we asked a "turtle" to draw the letter `M` on the floor of Upper Hadden Hall.

## Discussion

These activities illustrate that computers take instructions *very* literally.

There is no room for nuance when programming a computer – our instructions must be clear and detailed.

Further, we learned that there are two types of errors we will create when programming a computer.

1. A *syntax error* is when the computer does not understand an instruction. We may have:
	- mis-typed a command
	- omitted required information
2. A *logical error* is when the computer understands and carries out our instructions, but the result is not what we had intended.
   
## Conclusion

We should not be dismayed when errors are encountered.

*This is a normal part of writing software.*

We can use [all sorts of techniques to become effective at debugging](https://wizardzines.com/zines/debugging-guide/) – the process of resolving errors.
