Apple has a very good, brief, [written tutorial that describes the basics of taking screenshots](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/102646).

Each of the techniques described in that tutorial results in a file being saved to your computer's Desktop.

That is fine, but... your Desktop will end up cluttered with files over time.

There is a better way.

## Use the clipboard

The *clipboard* on your Mac is a special space in memory that holds anything that you might want to move from one application to another application – be that text, an image, or something else.

You are probably familiar with these keyboard shortcuts already:

|Shortcut|Name|Result|
|-|-|-|
|Command-C|Copy|Copies an item or text to the clipboard|
|Command-V|Paste|Pastes an item or text from the clipboard into the current document|

We can capture a screenshot *directly* into the clipboard on our computer, and then paste that screenshot anywhere – such as straight into a Notion post.

Here is a very short example, showing how Mr. Gordon shared the results of his **Name Plate** task:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
	<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1010441115?h=f8539417c1&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&portrait=0&byline=0&title=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Opening the Teamspace">
	</iframe>
	</div>
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

When you take a screenshot in this way, no files are left behind on your Desktop – you just get a screenshot, right where you want it. 😎
