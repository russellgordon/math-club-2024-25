A *smart folder* on macOS is essentially a saved search.

Once you have created a smart folder you can save it to the sidebar in Finder.

If you regularly search for the same type of file, this can be a real time-saver â€“ for example, when you are looking for the `PlaygroundDrawing.pdf` file:

![[Creating a Smart Folder.mp4]]
