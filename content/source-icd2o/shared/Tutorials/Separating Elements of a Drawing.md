When authoring programs with many visual elements, it can be helpful to separate elements of those drawings by returning the turtle to the origin.

We can do this using a `goToHome` function, using logic similar to what we just came up with in class a moment ago:

```swift
func goToHome() {
    // Save current position
    let currentX = turtle.currentPosition().x
    let currentY = turtle.currentPosition().y
    
    // Return to origin
    turtle.penUp()
    turtle.diagonal(dx: -1 * currentX, dy: -1 * currentY)
    turtle.penDown()
}
```

For example, when authoring this sketch in a prior year, Matthew Zhang used the `goToHome` function to isolate each part of his code:

Matthew *could* have copy-pasted the code inside his function to do this:

However, that results in multiple lines of essentially identical code.

It is better to *teach* the computer how to return to the origin by *defining* a function:

And then *invoking*, or calling, the function whenever you want to make the computer carry out the behaviours described in the function:

Note how Matthew's program invoked the `goToHome` function 31 times!

If he had simply copy-pasted the functionality, he would have used 186 lines of code:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&31 \text{ returns to the origin}\times 6 \text{ lines of code}
\\ &= 186 \text{ total lines of code}
\end{aligned}
$$

By instead defining a function, and then invoking it multiple times, Matthew used this many lines of code:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&8 \text{ lines of code to define function} \\
&+ 31 \text{ lines of code to invoke function} \\
&= 39 \text{ total lines of code}
\end{aligned}
$$

Matthew's program was significantly shorter as a result!

This is an example of applying abstraction – using functions.
