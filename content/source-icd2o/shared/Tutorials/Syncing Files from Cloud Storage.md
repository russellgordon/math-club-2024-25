## Local storage

A computer stores information – files that contain *apps* you run or *documents* you write – locally.

What does that mean?

When you open the Finder in macOS, you are viewing files kept on a storage device:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-11 at 5.44.57 AM.png]]

That storage device physically exists inside your computer.

Modern computers typically include a storage device known as a *solid state drive* or SSD, which can look like this (an SSD can come in several different sizes):

All storage devices have a *finite*, or limited, amount of space in which to hold files.

You can see how much space remains on your computer's local storage in several ways. 

Here is one way. Open the Finder by clicking it's icon in the Dock:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-11 at 5.54.53 AM.png|150]]

Navigate to the Applications folder:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-11 at 5.44.57 AM copy.png]]

Then from the **View** menu, select **Show Status Bar**:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-11 at 5.45.25 AM.png]]

The amount of local storage space remaining now appears at the bottom of the window:

### Advantages of local storage

Local storage on a computer is fast.

When files are stored on an SSD, they can be accessed *really* quickly.

Additionally, files kept on your own computer are yours.

Modern macOS *encrypts* local storage.

That means if your computer is lost or stolen, no one can easily see what files are on your computer without knowing what your account user name and password are.

### Disadvantages of local storage

As just noted, computers can be lost or stolen.

If you keep your files only within your computer's local storage, and your computer is gone, so are your files!

Perhaps more probable – computers can be damaged beyond repair.

A common example – spilling liquids on a computer. 

You might be careful, but is your roommate always careful? The person sitting next to you in class?

Finally, most likely – we can run out of space to store files locally.

For these reasons, it is convenient and practical to store *copies*, or duplicates of our files, on another computer.

## Cloud storage

When you hear the term "the cloud" that really just means many computers owned and operated by someone else – usually a large corporation.

Your computer communicates with computers "in the cloud" over the Internet.

A *server farm* is a facility that contains dozens or hundreds of computers working together to offer services – such as cloud storage of files – to a large number of customers:

Mr. Gordon has two cloud storage systems connected to his computer:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-11 at 5.44.57 AM copy 2.png]]

As a student at LCS you have access to Google Drive, a cloud storage system provided by Google.
### Advantages of cloud storage

Cloud storage is also finite, but sometimes offers more storage space than you have available to you locally.

Storing copies of your files "in the cloud" is also one form of *backup*.

If you have a copy of your files in cloud storage, and your computer becomes unusable or inaccesible to you, you can still get at your important information.
### Disadvantages of cloud storage

Accessing files stored exclusively in cloud storage is much slower than accessing files stored locally – this will be limited by the speed of your connection to the Internet.

When another entity has a copy of your data, you should always think carefully about your privacy – more on that topic in a future class.
## Installing Google Drive for Desktop

Google Drive for Desktop is an application that synchronizes files between the local storage on your computer and your cloud storage container within Google's server farm.

On top of the advantages listed above, syncing files means you can easily navigate around to locate your documents using the Finder – which is typically fast.

The alternative is clicking through a user interface in your web browser – this is sometimes slow.

### Obtain the installer

To get started, visit [Google Drive on the web](https://drive.google.com/) now.

You may need to log in using your LCS email address and password.

Afterwards, you'll see an interface something like this:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.44.06 PM.png]]

Or maybe like this:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.43.55 PM.png]]

Click the gear icon in the top right, and then click **Get Drive for desktop**:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.45.05 PM.png]]

If you use Safari – a fast, energy-efficient, and privacy-focused web browser – the resulting pop-up window may be blocked:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.45.18 PM.png]]

Just select the option to show the blocked pop-up window, since we know the pop-up window was created by something that we chose to do (as opposed to appearing randomly when we visited a web page):

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.45.18 PM 1.png]]

Then tap the **Download Drive for desktop** button:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.45.26 PM.png]]

Allow the file to be downloaded – since we know and trust the source of the download:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.45.33 PM.png]]

Then select the downloads queue, and navigate to the location of the file:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.45.43 PM.png]]

The interface for finding a downloaded file looks a little different in other web browsers, but the file will most likely have been placed in the Downloads folder on your computer:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.45.56 PM.png]]

### Run the installer

Double-click to open the **GoogleDrive.dmg** file that was downloaded, and you will see this:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.46.39 PM.png]]

Double-click the **GoogleDrive.pkg** file to run the **Drive for desktop** installer program, then press **Continue**:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.46.44 PM.png|500]]

On the next screen, select **Install**:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.46.48 PM.png|500]]

At this point, you will likely be prompted to provide the password for your computer's user account:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.46.52 PM.png|200]]

Unless you have changed it, that is the same password you use to log in to your LCS email account. Once you've typed your password, select **Install Software**:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.47.28 PM.png|200]]

After a few minutes, you'll see a confirmation that the install was successful:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.47.52 PM.png|500]]

You might see this message appear in the top-right corner of your computer:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.48.01 PM.png|300]]

That is OK. It means that the Drive for desktop app will be updated automatically by Google in the background, when needed. You can dismiss that dialog box.

In a moment, this dialog box will appear:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.47.56 PM.png|300]]

Select **Sign in with browser** and go through the sign-in process:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.48.14 PM.png]]

You did download the app from Google, so you can choose **Sign in** on this page:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.48.22 PM.png]]

After a moment, you will see this message – you can close the window when you see it:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.48.26 PM.png]]

You will see the following dialog pop up – go ahead and select **Open Preferences**:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.48.34 PM.png|300]]

You don't need a tour, so select **No thanks** here:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.48.45 PM.png|500]]

macOS may show you a dialog box like this – go ahead and select OK here to start syncing files from the cloud to the local storage device on your computer:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.48.55 PM.png|250]]

Next, you will see a dialog like this:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.49.03 PM.png|500]]

Go ahead and select **OK**. You can choose to sync files in one of two ways:

- Stream files
- Mirror files

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.49.21 PM.png]]

If you choose to mirror files, a local copy of each file in your Google Drive in the cloud is always kept on your computer.

If you don't have many files in your Google Drive in the cloud, mirroring files is a very good choice. It means, for example, that you could open and work on documents while you are not connected to WiFi. This could be useful when, for example, you are travelling to a game with your co-curricular team and spending potentially hours on a bus.

If you are worried about how much local storage space you have left on your computer, you can choose to mirror files. The main disadvantage here being that if you are not connected to WiFi when you try to access a file, you may not be able to use that file.

Make the selection that is best for you. You can then close the preferences window.

The **Drive for desktop** installer may finally show you this message:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.49.48 PM.png|500]]

Since you do not need the installer program any more, you can go ahead and select **Move to Trash**. You may then need to quit the installer program. You can do this using the **Command-Q** keyboard shortcut.
### Accessing your files

After installing **Drive for desktop** you will see there is now a new location – **Google Drive** – in the sidebar of your Finder windows:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.50.11 PM.png]]

Double-click into the **My Drive** folder and you will see more files and folders:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.50.16 PM.png]]

These are a duplicate of the files and folders you have created in Google Drive for the web:

![[Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 8.51.52 PM.png]]

### Organizing your files

You can see that Mr. Gordon is pretty organized. 😎

Take a moment to create a folder for your grade 10 year at LCS.

Then create subject folders for each course you are taking.

You create folders directly inside the Finder using the **Command-Shift-N** keyboard shortcut.

It's generally much faster to create folders using the Finder as compared to creating folders in Google Drive on the web, through a broswer.

You will note that after a few seconds, your local storage and Google Drive on the web are in sync.

Optionally, you can choose to move other folders on your computer into the **My Drive** folder.

This means that they will be backed up to Google Drive on the web, and accessible both locally through the Finder and through the web using a browser.

Congratulations! You're all done for now. 🎉
