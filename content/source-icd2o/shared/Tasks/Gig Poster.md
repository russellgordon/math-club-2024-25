## Objective
Loosely follow the [style of Swiss modernism as illustrated by Mike Joyce's work](https://www.swissted.com) and create your own custom gig poster for an [actual concert that has occured in the past](https://www.concertarchives.org) for a given band or musical artist that you like.

## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Installing Playgrounds|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] Another copy of the [[Subscribe to Turtle Sketches|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Custom Gig Poster*
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook
- [ ] Writing instruments, including a ruler or straight edge

## Success criteria
- [ ] a hand-drawn plan is made using either a:
	- storyboard approach
		- e.g.: you illustrate, step by step, what parts of the poster you will draw in what order
	 - sketch of entire poster
		 - e.g.: you analyse your sketch and:
			 - [ ] number key elements in the order they will be drawn (sequence)
			 - [ ] identify numerical patterns in the position of elements (where iteration might be used)
			 - [ ] identify similar visual elements in your poster (where abstraction using functions might be used)
	
> [!NOTE]
> Your plan *must* be [shared on Notion](https://notion.so) and approved by Mr. Gordon prior to starting to write code. 

 - ∙ to ==meet== expectations, your code should:
	- [ ] show an understanding of *sequence* by producing output that matches your plan
	- [ ] show an understanding of *iteration* by using loops to draw repeated elements

- ∙ to ==exceed== expectations, your code should:
	- [ ] show an understanding of *abstraction* by making use of functions that include parameters
	- [ ] show an understanding of *selection* by making use of `if` statements

- [ ] use [color combinations that are appealing](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/#organic-color-inspiration)

> [!NOTE]
> You may use the eyedropper tool to sample [colors from the examples shown](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/#organic-color-inspiration).

- [ ] code should include [[Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently|correctly indented]]
- [ ] Playground is regularly backed up [[Duplicating a Sketch in Playgrounds|by making duplicates]], using filenames like:
	- `Custom Gig Poster`
	- `Custom Gig Poster v2`
	- `Custom Gig Poster v3`
	- *`et cetera`*

> [!NOTE]
> Create a [[Showing That Regular Backups Were Made|short screen recording like this one]] to show that your poster was backed up regularly, then [share it on Notion](https://notion.so). Note how seven versions of the playgrounds were made across an hour – a new version made after each significant bit of progress. **You must show the backups made using the list view in Finder.**

- [ ] poster must be for an [actual concert that occurred in the past](https://www.concertarchives.org)


## Exemplar

### Plan

Any of the plans shared for lessons in this module would be suitable:

- [[Blur Poster|Blur]]
	- Good example identifying sequence (order to draw things in)
	- How to use iteration (analysis to determine where loop)
- [[Replacements Poster|Replacements]]
	- Identifies sequence
	- Analyses where functions might be used
	- Details on how to draw parts of design shown
- [[Refused Poster|Refused]]
	- Good detail anlaysing how two loops can be used to draw pattern

### Process

You *must* post about your progress at multiple points while you write your code.

Here is an example from last year:

> [!NOTE]
> Last year students used slightly different portfolio software.

In your portfolio entries, share screenshot(s) of your current work in the **Progress section**.

In the **Learning** section, briefly summarize key achievements using subject-specific vocabulary.

In the **Questions** section, ask about anything that you need a hand with, and Mr. Gordon will reply or be ready to answer your question in the next class.

### A complete exemplar

Mr. Gordon completed this task, too. [View his work here to see a complete exemplar](https://www.notion.so/lakefieldcs/868d23e3bf67415b92f37f61086d6d3f?v=3ab707db12414dd68a511df18241f84c&pvs=4) for how to meet and exceed expectations.

## Handing in your work

When you have finished the code for this task, please complete the **Coding Task – Final Entry** template, and be sure to respond to these prompts...

![[Screenshot 2023-09-25 at 9.03.41 PM.png|250]]

1. What was the hardest part of authoring your poster? Why?
2. What technique that we learned about in this module – sequence, iteration, abstraction, or selection, was most important for creating your poster? Why?

## Due date

You must add all required elements described above in to your portfolio *prior* by the end of our final period on Friday, November 29, 2024.

No exceptions – please, plan ahead – everything will take longer than you expect to finish. 

## Learning goals

Successful completion of this task is great evidence of mastery for learning goals 1, 4, 5, and 6.
