# Panda Scene
## Objective
Create a scene that includes a passable reproduction of a panda (or other animal) to refresh your understanding of why *sequence* – order of statements – matters when writing code.
## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Installing Playgrounds|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] Another copy of the [[Subscribe to Turtle Sketches|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Panda Scene*
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook
- [ ] Writing instruments, including a ruler or straight edge

## Success criteria
- [ ] a hand-drawn plan is made using a *storyboard approach*, to help think through the necessary sequence of steps to create at least *part* of your drawing
- [ ] a recognizable image of a panda (or another animal) is drawn in Playgrounds
- [ ] good use of fills, borders, and color is applied to create a background scene
- [ ] code includes [[Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently|correctly indented]]
- [ ] Playground is regularly backed up [[Duplicating a Sketch in Playgrounds|by making duplicates]], using filenames like:
	- `Panda Scene`
	- `Panda Scene v2`
	- `Panda Scene v3`
	- *`et cetera`*

## Exemplar

This rough plan does not include any co-ordinates and does not need to – the numbered storyboards make it clear what order shapes will be drawn in, and when those shapes will be filled:

This finished product makes great use of overlapping shapes to create a compelling scene:

## Exploring and Getting Started

As always, try typing `turtle.` to see what capabilities the `turtle` instance of the `Tortoise` class offers:

Here is an example showing the code that reproduces the start of the exemplar:

> [!TIP]
> Remember to use [[Using Autocomplete and Keyboard Shortcuts|keyboard shortcuts and the autocomplete features of the Playgrounds app]] to your advantage. You can press the `Tab` key to move between placeholders.

## Portfolio entries

Be sure to share your plan in a portfolio post *before* you write code.

Share an update at the end of today's class on your progress.

When you finish your work on this task, please make a post in your portfolio on [Notion](https://notion.so) and share whatever you feel describes your understanding. As well, please respond to these prompts:

- Where in your code was sequence especially important? Provide a short code excerpt and speak to this.
- Provide examples showing how you made your code as readable as possible, and describe specific strategies you used to author readable code.

## Learning goals
Successful completion of this task is great evidence of progress toward mastering  learning goals 1, 4, and 5.
