## Objective

Create *two* different procedures that give a class such as: 
- `Biped`
- `Quadruped`
- `Swimmer`
- `Flyer`
- `Slitherer`
  
... a new ability. 

Document your procedures so that other people know how to use them.

## Purpose

Once everyone does this, we will have a "menu" of abilities for different classes in Alice:

This will allow each of you to make a more realistic and creative Alice world for your end-of-module assignment.

## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] [[Getting Started with Alice|Alice installed]] on your computer.

## Success criteria and exemplar

For *each* procedure you write, you will:

- [ ] accept at least one parameter
- [ ] make a [brief screen recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R6MeplH1Sf-8C8w7Yql393CQ19C4tpad/view) that shows what your procedure looks like
- [ ] export your Alice procedure into an `.a3c` file
- [ ] fill in [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_LakGY9NncwgEwylJX11jS6Vlzz2YejJ7fAV4q2Uo8s/copy) to document how your procedure works (replacing the examples shown with your own information)

 For example:

## Progress

You *must* post about your progress at multiple points while you write your code.

In your portfolio entries, share screenshot(s) of your current work in the **Progress section**.

In the **Learning** section, briefly summarize key achievements using subject-specific vocabulary.

In the **Questions** section, ask about anything that you need a hand with, and Mr. Gordon will reply or be ready to answer your question in the next class.

## Learning goals
