## Evaluation Checklist

|Category|Essential question|Not at all|In part|Fully|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Thinking|Did you take careful notes during our first visit to collect desired features from your partners at LDPS?||||
|Communication|Did you engage respectfully and fully with your partner group while collecting design goals and desired features on our first visit to LDPS?||||
|Thinking|Did you produce a clear plan, either in paper prototype of storyboard form, in time for our second visit to LDPS?||||
|Communication|Did you engage respectfully and fully with your partner group while explaining your paper prototype?||||
|Knowledge|While developing your first playable prototype, were you able to navigate the interface of your development environment, and demonstrate the ability to, for the most part, independently debug logical errors in your application?||||
|Application|Did you produce a minimum viable product to demonstrate, as a prototype, in time for our third visit to LDPS?||||
|Knowledge|While developing the final version of your app, were you able to navigate the interface of your development environment, and demonstrate the ability to, for the most part, independently debug logical errors in your application?||||
|Application|Did you produce a final version of your application that met expectations for your partner group and had clear improvements over your earlier prototype?||||

## Exemplar

Here is one example of an app completed in 2019, when this partnership with LDPS last occurred.

This is *Mario Treasure Hunt*, a game that teaches Cartesian co-ordinates through play.

## Software

The programming environment used to solve a problem is generally determined by considering user requirements.

In most but not all cases, this is likely to be [Alice](https://www.alice.org/resources/), but you may optionally use [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com) or [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu).

## Process

For each day of class, you *must* post about your progress [on Notion](https://notion.so).

Share screenshot(s) or photo(s) of your current work in the **Progress** section.

In the **Learning** section, briefly summarize key achievements using subject-specific vocabulary.

In the **Questions** section, ask about anything that you need a hand with, being certain to preface your question with `@Russell Gordon`, and Mr. Gordon will reply or be ready to answer your question in the next class.
