## Objective
Write an Alice world that tells a story that has meaning to you, or, make a small game in Alice that involves movement using a [[First Person Perspective, Proximity, and Scoring|first-person perspective]].

## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] [[Getting Started with Alice#Installing Alice|Alice installed]] on your computer.

## Success criteria

Be sure to:

- [ ] make use of at least one sound file
- [ ] make use of at least *two* [[Movement in 3D Space|specific camera movements]] that we studied
- [ ] use at least *five* [class-level procedures written by your peers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JM61FLf4z4QyV-vSMU70yps59xhMvciPA8UysN_kFyE/edit)
- [ ] when working with distances, you use [[Functions and Expressions|functions and expressions]] rather than hard-coded values
- [ ] write well organized code by using comments and grouping sections of your code into procedures

## Progress

You *must* post about your progress at multiple points while you write your code.

In your portfolio entries, share screenshot(s) or a short screen recording of your current work in the **Progress section**.

In the **Learning** section, briefly summarize key achievements using subject-specific vocabulary.

In the **Questions** section, ask about anything that you need a hand with, and Mr. Gordon will reply or be ready to answer your question in the next class.

## Handing in your work

When you are all done:

1. Submit the **.a3p** file in a final post regarding this task [on Notion](https://notion.so).
2. Include a video showing your complete animation or game.
3. Please respond to this one question:
	- What was the single hardest thing you had to figure out to complete your task?
	- How does the code for that part of your task work? Please explain using clear subject-specific vocabulary.
