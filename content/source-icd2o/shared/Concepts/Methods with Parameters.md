## Connection to earlier learning

Earlier this year, we learned how to use *functions*.

Functions are an example of applying abstraction, which generally helps us to avoid writing repetitive code.

For example, at the start the [[The Replacements Gig Poster - Applying Abstraction|lesson]] to reproduce [[Replacements Poster|the Replacements gig poster]] from last module, we saw how a simple function, written in Swift, allows us to save many lines of code:

![[Screen Shot 2022-12-11 at 11.21.58 AM.png]]

Later, we learned how adding *parameters* to our functions make them even more useful. This process is referred to as *generalization*.

We used a function to draw the "circle in square" pattern:

![[IMG_F1AB638FD722-1.jpeg]]

The function draws the same design each time, differentiated only by the parameters that exist – in this case – a parameter for the color – and a second parameter for the anchor position to draw from:

We are now going to apply this same idea in a 3D Alice world.

## Terminology

First, though, a brief sidebar about terminology.

Software developers use the following terms nearly interchangeably:

- function
- procedure
- method

You will read all three of those words in this lesson.

When you read them, think: "This is a way to teach the computer a new trick."

Essentially, those three terms mean the same thing.

## Eliminating repetitive code

After completing the [[Functions and Expressions#Exercise: Lost and Found|"Lost and Found" exercise in the prior tutorial]], you would be forgiven for feeling it was a little tedious – there is so much duplicated code!

![[Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 5.54.40 AM.png]]

Surely there is a better way!

Of course there is.

We can *apply abstraction* so that what currently takes thirty-five lines of code takes just seven (not including comments) instead:

Just as we "taught" the turtle new tricks in prior modules of this course, we can "teach" all objects of a certain type how to approach an item.

## Inheritance and data types

Before we do so, a brief digression to discuss data types is required.

Alice is an *object-oriented* programming environment.

When you drag a tile from the gallery into an Alice world, you are creating an *instance* of a *class*:

Here an instance of the `AdultPerson` class is being created.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 5.59.55 AM.png|600]]

The instance, also called an *object*, is named `astronaut`.

Classes exist in a hierarchy:

![[Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 6.03.02 AM.png|175]]

Crucially, a class will *inherit* capabilities from its parent classes.

What does that really mean?

If you teach the `Biped` class to do something new, then *all subclasses* of `Biped` will inherit that same capability.

## Creating a procedure on a class

We need to make it possible for our `ElderPerson` instance in this world to look for their AirPods.

> [!NOTE]
> If desired, you can [download this Alice world to follow along with the tutorial](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/icd2o/Lost_and_Found_-_Complete%20solution.a3p.zip) from this point forward.

To do this, we will create a procedure named `approach` on the `Biped` class.

### Create the procedure

In order, we must:

1. Tap the class navigator button.
2. Select `Biped`.
3. Select `Add Biped Procedure`.

![[Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 6.13.11 AM.png|550]]

Now we give the new procedure a name – by convention, we use `camelCaseNaming`:

![[Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 6.15.51 AM.png|350]]

### Add code to the procedure

Switch back to `myFirstMethod` by clicking it's tab (<span style="color:red">1</span>):

![[Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 6.31.07 AM.png]]

Hold the `Option` or `⌥` key down and drag the tile that contains the code you want to use into the clipboard:

![[Dragging to Clipboard.gif]]

Now switch back to the `approach` method (<span style="color:red">1</span>):

![[Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 6.32.28 AM.png]]

And drag the code out of the clipboard:

![[Dragging out of Clipboard.gif]]

### Generalize the procedure

At this point you may be concerned because there are a lot of red error tiles:

![[Screenshot 2023-02-15 at 6.36.57 AM.png]]

These red error tiles exist because they refer to *specific objects* within our world.

This is a problem, because when we teach a class – `Biped` in this case – how to do something new – the procedure must work in *all* situations – not just with specific objects in a specific world.

So, we must *generalize* – this is a key part of applying abstraction.

Fortunately, it's a relatively simple process:

1. Where we see `this.elderPerson` we'll instead say `this` which refers to whatever object will do the work of approaching something in the future.
2. Where we see `this.bell` we'll instead add a parameter named `item`. So the `approach` method can be used to approach *any* item – not just a bell.
3. Finally, where we see `this.origin` we'll instead add a parameter named `returningToStartingPoint`.  So the `approach` method can be used to have the biped return to a provided starting point after it approaches an item.

So, let's do this in order.

First, replace all instances of `this.elderPerson` with `this`:

![[Generalizing Step 1.gif]]

Second, we add a parameter named `item`. It's value type will be `Prop`. This controls what type of objects can be passed into the parameter:

![[Adding a Parameter.gif]]

Now, whereever we see `this.bell` we replace the reference with the parameter named `item`:

![[Using the First Parameter.gif]]

Third and finally, we add a parameter named `returningToStartingPoint` to allow the user of the procedure to specify where the Biped returns to after approaching an item:

![[Creating Second Parameter.gif]]

Then, whereever we see `this.origin` we replace the reference with the parameter `returningToStartingPoint`:

![[Using Second Parameter.gif]]

### Use the procedure

Now we can go ahead and use our new procedure!

This is fun because we get to delete a lot of repetitive code and use the procedure instead.

For the first object – the bell – here's how to replace the old code with the new procedure:

![[Using the Procedure.gif]]

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Replace repetitive code

For the remaining objects in this scenario, replace the old code with the procedure instead.

When you are done, the program should look like this:

### Exercise 2: Three Little Pigs

Create a scene for the children's story known as *[The Three Little Pigs](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zobcwetN-L0)*.

This will involve a wolf approaching three different houses, and saying something to each pig.

Consider how you could make use of a procedure in this scenario:

- What actions would always be the same?
- What actions would differ from one pig to the next?
	- That is where parameters are needed.

Alternatively, create a different, original scene that makes use, in some way, of a procedure that has parameters.
