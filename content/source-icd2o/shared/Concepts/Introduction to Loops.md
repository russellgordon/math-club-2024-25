# Introduction to Loops

If we wanted someone to walk 5 steps toward us, it's easier to say just that – rather than say:

- walk 1 step
- walk 1 step
- walk 1 step
- walk 1 step
- walk 1 step

In the same way, we can use a loop to have a computer repeat an instruction – or a block of multiple instructions – more than once.
## Creating a loop

To make a function in Swift Playgrounds, just begin typing the keyword `for`, and then press the **Return** key to use autocomplete:

You will then have a template for a function that you can fill in:

First, fill in the *number*.

That describes how many times you want the block of code to run.

Let's choose 5:

Next, copy the code shown here below into the body of the loop:

```swift
turtle.penDown()
turtle.forward(distance: 50)
turtle.penUp()
turtle.forward(distance: 50)
```

... replacing the placeholder:

... with the code:

The opening `{` marks the start of the code block that will be repeated.

The closing `}` marks the end of the code block that will be repeated.

If you press **Command-Shift-R** to step through the code in the playground, you will see how the loop repeats the code:
