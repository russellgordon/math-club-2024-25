## A profile of one graduate

Writing code is an abstract task.

Seeing graphical output from the code you write as a beginning programmer helps to make the abstract *concrete* – that is to to say – more easily understood.

We create graphical output in this course as a *means to an end* – that end is learning how to program a computer.

It turns out that programming a computer to express yourself creatively is something that many people do professionally.

In other words, making art with a computer can be not just the *means*, but the *end* – the entire point – as well.

Jamie Haberman is a past student of mine, a graduate of [The Bishop Strachan School](https://www.bss.on.ca), who attended the [Iovine and Young Academy at the University of Southern California](https://iovine-young.usc.edu/discover/founders) after finishing high school.

Jamie is now a [product designer in Silicon Valley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-haberman-482958114/) but in 2014, she was experimenting with iteration in my class in a course somewhat similar to the one you are in now.
