notes: The idea here is just to show students where we are heading in this module. Encourage them to review the posters on the wall outside room 36 (actually, can take a "mini field-trip" over there to take a look).

Here are a few examples of what students authored in this module of the course in the past:

You can see the complete array of the products from last year on the wall outside room 36.

Before the end of November, you will have made your own custom gig poster. ðŸ’«
