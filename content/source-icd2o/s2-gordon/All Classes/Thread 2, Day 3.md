## Agenda
1. Portfolio: Acknowledging Feedback and Making Improvements
	- Feedback has been provided now on the first two days of classes.
	- Please react with a 👍🏼 or other emoji to indicate you have read each piece of feedback.
	- As needed (this applies to most, but not all students) make improvements to your portfolio post(s) before starting today's task.
1. Tutorial: [[Creating a Smart Folder]]
2. Concept: [[Fills and Borders]]
3. Exercise: [[Ramones]]
	- Show that you really understand iteration and sequence by reproducing this gig poster. 🎸
	- You are meant to work largely independently today – but as always, are encouraged to consult with and help your peers.
	  
## Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make a portfolio post [on Notion](https://notion.so) and summarize what you've learned today about patterning, iteration, and loops.
