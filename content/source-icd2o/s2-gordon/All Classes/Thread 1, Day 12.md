## Agenda
1. Task: [[T-Shirt Shadow Prints]]
	- Any students who did not finish their shirt yesterday will do so today.
1. Portfolio: Final Portfolio Review
	- Mr. Gordon will have quick chats with students regarding their portfolio and progress in the course.
	- A few students have received some feedback already – be sure to check [Notion](https://notion.so) and complete your [[Thread 1 Self-Assessment|self-assessment]] or add additional evidence to your portfolio.
1. Exercise: [[Computer Security with Hacktivate]]
	- If you are finished making your shirt, and have made any suggested additions to your portfolio, you are welcome to continue on these exercises – we will also be re-visiting this in the next thread of this course in December.
