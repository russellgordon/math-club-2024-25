```swift
// Make the turtle return to the origin
func goHome() {
    
    // Pick up the pen so a trail is not left behind
    turtle.penUp()
    
    // Get the turtle's current position
    let x = turtle.currentPosition().x
    let y = turtle.currentPosition().y

    // Go home, using the opposite value of turtle's position
    turtle.diagonal(dx: x * -1, dy: y * -1)
    
    // Put down the pen again
    turtle.penDown()
}

## Your first entry

The purpose of your portfolio is to share evidence of understanding of our course learning goals. Please [review the course outline](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dRBdmlN6Gu955Lw10bWbd8QZ2_GojEEB/view) for a refresher on how you are assessed and evaluated in this course, if needed.

Click on the example post provided:

### Sharing progress

In the **Progress** section, you simply share what you have done for this course since your last post.

A few sentences might be enough sometimes, but the more you expand on what you accomplished, the better the evidence of your understanding tends to be.

Note how the author of this example post included at least one screenshot to support what they described accomplishing:

### Asking questions

In the **Questions** section, describe anything you are wondering about or stuck on:

Mr. Gordon will reply and answer your questions prior to the start of our next class.

You will get individualized written feedback!

### Identifying the learning

A bit later on this course we will discuss learning goals and how to tag your posts as being appropriate evidence for a given learning goal.

Today, you can leave the **Learning** section blank.

## Making your first post

To actually make your own first post, click the blue **New** button:

It's a good idea to write a descriptive title.

Some students prefer to make a title that summarizes the main topics they made progress on.

For today's class, that might be "Intro to Algorithms and File Management".

Some students like to make a title that describes the current day of the course. For example: "Thread 1, Day 1":

Go ahead and write within the sections provied.

You can add new "blocks" or places to provide information as needed.
